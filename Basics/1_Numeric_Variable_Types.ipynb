For those of you who have worked with Python before and are comfortable with programming, it might be easy. For some, it may only be the second time they've heard of most of the topics and some of the exercises might already be challenging. That's fine! No one becomes a true Pythonista overnight. To become good at programming, you need one thing above all: **practice**! And that's why today we will start by reviewing the basics. \n",

Although `my_first_variable` would be in snake_case it is not a good variable name. In order to make your code more readable and maintainable you should always give your variables well-defined, succinct names. Calling something `height` is a lot more meaningful than only calling it `x`. \n",
