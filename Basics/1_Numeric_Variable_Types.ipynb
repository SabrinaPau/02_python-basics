The name duck comes from the classic \"If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\" adage.

Python follows a variable naming convention called snake case. To write something in snake case, simply use a `_` anywhere you would use a space, and make sure every word is lower case. For example, `this_is_a_variable`. Giving variables good names makes your code more readable and therefore maintainable. There is a big difference between seeing a variable called `degrees` and one called `y`. You should strive to give your variables well-defined, succinct names.\n",

A common example is the use of `i` to keep track of an index (we will cover this idea next week).
